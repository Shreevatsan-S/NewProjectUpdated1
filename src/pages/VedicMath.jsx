                <p>
                    Vedic Mathematics has its origin in the Atharva Veda of Vedas, forming part of Jyotish Shastra, one of the six parts of Vedangas. It is the ancient system of Indian Mathematics rediscovered from the Vedas between 1911 and 1918 by Sri Bharati Krsna Tirthaji (1884-1960).

                    According to his research, all of mathematics is based on sixteen Sutras, or word-formulae, described in the Vedas. For example, ‘Vertically and crosswise’ is one of these Sutras. These formulae describe the way the mind naturally works and are therefore a great help in directing the student to the appropriate method of solution.

                    The simplicity of Vedic Mathematics allows for mental calculations, though the methods can also be written down. This flexibility leads to many advantages, including the ability for pupils to invent their own methods, fostering creativity, interest, and intelligence.
